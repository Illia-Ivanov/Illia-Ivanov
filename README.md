Hello every body!

I'm a novice System Administrator eager to establish myself in the field.

I possess the following skills: Linux, Bash Scripting, Docker, Kuberntes, Gitlab, Github, IT Support at all and SQL

I would also like to say that I am a fast learner and with good team skills I'm always open to new proposals.
